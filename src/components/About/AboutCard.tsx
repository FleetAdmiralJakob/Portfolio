            Since I got my first computer for my enrollment in elementary
            school, I've been fascinated by figuring out what's behind the
            applications I use. That's why I started programming{" "}
            {convert.toWords(year - 2019)} years ago and have been increasingly
            passionate about it ever since and I have at least learnt something,

            As a Zoomer, I am very interested in software engineering, as I
            belong to a generation that grows up with these technologies and
            engages with them every day.
            <br />
            <br />
            My preferences are by classics like
            <i>
              <b className="purple"> Typescript, Kotlin and C#. </b>
            </i>
            <br /> But I'm always open to make new experiences.
            <br />
            <br />
            My field of interests are building new
            <i>
              <b className="purple"> Web Technologies and Products </b> and also
              in areas related to <b className="purple"> Game Development. </b>
              But I am also interested in{" "}
              <b className="purple"> Mobile Development </b> with languages like{" "}
              <b className="purple"> Kotlin and Java.</b>
            </i>
            <br />
            <br />
            Whenever possible, I also apply my passion for developing products
            with <b className="purple">Node.js</b> and
            <i>
              <b className="purple">
                {" "}
                Modern Javascript Library and Frameworks
